## Idea

Out_Side is hypothetically a creative company that tells original stories for exciting brands, recording artists and film and game studios.
The aim of the website is to showcase work, inspirations and create new work/ideas from interactions with the users.

## Why?
Initially I wanted to create an online playground or better platform that mainly explores a user's journey from arrival to departure in a playful manner. I'm interested in why sites look and feel like a 'website', i.e why has a hamburger icon become the standard? and why do we have navigation bars at the top of the page and not the side? To explore this the user would be given a series of website elements to interact with, which would produce changes in their journey through to departure. 
These questions are part of a long format project and this website is the first step.

## Folder Organization:

### Assets
The assets folder comprises two folders that separate the **stylesheet** & **media**.

### HTML
Located at the top level of the codebase is the index.html and test.html (not in use) markup files.


## Development:

### Visual design 

## Why?

The overall theme for the website is based off a pastel rainbow palette. These colors evoke cute/innocent, attractive, welcoming, childlike-play and soft-delight.

The idealism found in the roots of an AI powered world has also been an inspiration. Leaning more towards a 'cute-cyberpunk', with soft pink pastel neons as opposed to a darker dystopian world. The aim was to avoid the cynical AI canon which has become commonplace in the media.

### Structural Elements

![wireframe](https://github.com/m-u-r-r-a-y/ci-project1/blob/main/docs/thumbnail_ci-project1-website-design%20.png)

The aim was to have a single page website, delivered in a minimal but aesthetically pleasing manner to showcase
the company's works and ideas.

#### Moving icon (animation)

I designed a shapeshifting icon to give the hero section an element of spontaneity and distraction. I wanted 
the user's eye to follow the shape then become hypnotized out of their current thinking and 
into a new world of fantasy and dream. I also worked on slowing the animation to stop it being painful.

#### Newsletter

To add another playful element to the form, we request the user to tell us what is their favourite ice cream.

## Performance:
This is the original score produced by lighthouse on Chrome.

After changing the images to a modern web format such as webp and creating a preload function within the html 
This was the result I received. There are still improvements to be made, however this site is media heavy so the design may also need to change to resolve it.

## Validation and accessibility:

### CSS validator

### HTML markup validator
The validator tested the page and resulted in 50 warnings which refer to formating done by Prettier, the extension in VS Code.

> Trailing slash on void elements has no effect and interacts badly with unquoted attribute values.
