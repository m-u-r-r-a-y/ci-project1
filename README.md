## Idea

Out_Side is hypothethically a creative company that tells original stories for exciting brands, recording artists and film and game studios.
The aim of the website is to showcase work, inspirations and create new work/ideas from interactions with the users.

## Why?
Initially I wanted to create an online playground or better platofrm that mainly explores a users journey from arrival to depature in a playful manner. I'm intrested in why sites are to look and feel like a 'website', i.e why has a hamburger icon become the standard? and why do we have navigtion bars at the top of th page and not the side? To explore this the user would be given a series of website elements to interact with, which would produce changes in their journey through to departure. 
These questions are part of a long format project and this website is the first step.

## Folder Organisation:

### Assets
The assets folder comprises two folders that separate the **stylesheet** & **media**.

### HTML
Located at the top level of the codebase is the index.html and test.html (not in use) markup files.


## Development:

### Visual design 

##Why

The overall theme for the website is based off a pastel rainbow pallette. These colors evoke cute/innocent, attractive, welcoming, childlike-play and soft-delight.

The idealism found in the roots an AI powered world has also been an inspiration. Leaning more towards a 'cute-cyberpunk', with soft pink pastel neons as opposed to a darker dystopian world. The aim was to avoid the cynical AI canon which has become commonplace in the media.

### Structural Elements

![wireframe](https://github.com/m-u-r-r-a-y/ci-project1/blob/main/docs/thumbnail_ci-project1-website-design%20.png)

The aim was to have a single page website, delivered in a minimal but aestheicly pleasing manner to showcase the company's works and ideas.

#### Moving icon (annimation)

I designed a shapeshifting icon at the top of th page to give the hero section of the page an element of spontenainety and distraction. I wanted the user's eye to 
follow the shape and for their brain become hyponotized out of their current thinking and into an new world of fantasy and dream. I worked on slowing the annimation
