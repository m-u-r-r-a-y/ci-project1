## Idea

Out_Side is hypothethically a creative studio that tells original stories for fashion labels, brands, recording artists and film and game studios.
The aim of the website is to showcase work, inspirations and create new work /ideas with interactions from the users.

## Why?
Initially I wanted to create an online playground or better website that mainly explores a users journey from arrival to depature. I'm intrested why sites are built with a particular template feel, i.e why has a hamburger icon become the standard? and why do we have navigtion bars at the top of th page and not the side?
To explore this the user would be given a series of website elements to interact with which would produce changes in their journey through to departure. 

## Folder Organisation

### Assets
The assets folder comprises two folders that separate the **stylesheet** & **media**.

### HTML
Located at the top level of the codebase is the index html and test html (not in use ) markup file.


## Development

### Visual design

The overall theme for the website is based off pastel rainbow pallette. These colors evoke cute/innocent, attractive, childlike-play and soft-delight.
